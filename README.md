Challenges:
THe first challenge was to get acquainted to the modules that will be used in the exercises. Then I had a hard time implementing the conditions on the array parameter on the addAccount function. Specifically, I had troubles in implementing the validator module since I experience errors when combining it to a conditional statement. I used different string functions from w3schools to trim and transform letters to lower case.
